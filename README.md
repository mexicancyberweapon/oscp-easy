## Introduction

This is a culmination of me looking through all of the resources I could find for the OSCP exam. I will give all of the important topics, resources to learn, and commands to copy. I have also attached my CherryTree notes that I used to pass my exam.

### The Exam:
  You are given **23 hours and 45 minutes** to complete this exam. After, you are given another **24 hours** to submit your documentation. The exam must be proctored, so read the [proctoring tool manual](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008126631-Proctored-Exams).
  
### Exam Structure:
  
  The OSCP exam is structured like this:

  - **3 stand alone machines (each worth 20 points for a 60 point total):**
      - 20 points per machine
        
        - 10 points for initial access
        -  10 points for privilege escalation
        
  - **1 Active Directory set with 3 machines (worth 40 points):**
      - 10 points for machine 1
      - 10 points for machine 2
      - 20 points for machine 3

### Forbidden Tools:
  The OSCP does not allow the use of MetaSploit
